I am a second-year doctoral student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Sceinces](https://stat.utexas.edu/) at the Univesity of Texas at Austin, where I am jointly advised by [Alessandro Rinaldo](https://arinaldo.github.io/) and [Purnamrita Sarkar](https://psarkar.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of high-dimensional statistics and deep learning, with an interest in developing computationally efficient sampling algorithms and applying them to statiscal inference problems, uncertainty quantification and fairness.

Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, where I had the privelege to be advised by [Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io/). I also had the opportunity to work with [Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/), [Vipul Arora](https://vipular.github.io/) and [Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
